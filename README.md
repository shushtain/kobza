# Kobza

Free and open source English (as a second language) course

> ⚠️ **Pre-alpha**  
> There are no actual lessons yet, just a functioning `JSON → HTML` parser.

## Idea

- As an English teacher from Ukraine, the only thing that always stopped me from working independently is the absence of my own teaching materials.
- Even official private schools often buy a single book to teach hundreds of students, which is pirating.
- So-called "multimedia solutions" basically offer interactive wrappers on top of

Let's make a free and open source English course happen, to make it easier for teachers.

> 💅 Kobza is a Ukrainian musical instrument, a prototype of Bandura.

## Features and goals

- [x] Parse JSON lessons into web pages.
- [ ] Fix styles (currently copied from somewhere else for testing).
- [ ] Vocabulary flashcards.
- [ ] Interactive warmup activities.
- [ ] Interactive exercises and tests.

> I would prefer to use a more accessible format for providing lessons. I have been parsing them from markdown previously, but the basic syntax is not enough. Markdown doesn't have "flashcards" or "sort the words" blocks.

## Ways to help

- Supply your own lesson materials to expand the coverage.
- Help fix mistakes (I'm only a self-taught C1 enjoyer, so...)
- Point out where my ~~shitty~~ code is especially bad.
- Maybe something else?
