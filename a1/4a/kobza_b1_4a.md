Look at the timelines and discuss:

1. Which events are finished?
2. Which situations continue to the present?
3. How do we express these differences in English?

## Grammar Focus (20 minutes, Advanced, Individual)

### Past Simple vs Present Perfect

#### Past Simple

- Finished actions at a specific time in the past
- No connection to the present
- Time expressions: yesterday, last week, in 2020, ago

Examples:

- She graduated in 2020.
- They moved here two years ago.

#### Present Perfect

- Past actions with present relevance
- Experiences without specific time
- Continuing situations
- Time expressions: just, already, yet, ever, never, since, for

Examples:
